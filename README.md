# WeatherPY
WeatherPY is a Python wrapper for the National Weather Service's public [API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/).
This library is purely a personal project that I am using to practice writing practical Python libraries.
If for some reason you want to use the code from this project, feel free. It is under MIT license so there are barely any restrictions.
